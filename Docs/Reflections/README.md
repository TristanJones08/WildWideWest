# Project Reflections

### Instructions
Each group member needs to create a reflection document. The document should be named like this:  
[first initial][last name].md  
So for example if Mr. Lemke were in your group, his file would be named `rlemke.md`.  
  
You may organize your reflection folders however you'd like, but below I've provided an example format using markdown (which is what .md files are). You can find more markdown notation [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).  
  
More information about what is expected in each reflection is available in the project rubric.
